              I'm on a life-long mission to learn to play the guitar and (more
              recently) the Kora, a type of harp from West Africa. You can see

            <h2>My story...</h2>
            <p>
              After picking up the Spanish guitar aged 13, I quickly became
              fascinated by choro music from Brazil. My love of music from all
              around the world had begun! In 2001, I founded{" "}
              <a href="http://www.smerins.com" target="_blank">
                Smerin's Anti-Social Club
              </a>{" "}
              with the same group of friends that still play in the band to this
              day. The Buena Vista covers are long gone now, replaced with an
              eclectic blend of influences and an energy that have seen the band
              become regulars on the UK's festival circuit.
            </p>

            <p>
              In recent years, I've taken up playing the kora and fallen in love
              with the music of the Mandinka people of West Africa. In 2018 I
              travelled to Senegal and The Gambia, and encountered some
              incredible musicians who I have written about in the blog,
              including{" "}
